##8. Who am I writing to? II

###a) What motivates them?
- the need to improve the effectiveness of their company,
- the desire to have everything neatly organized,
- the ability to quickly assess their company’s capabilities (e.g. when a potential client calls),
- good for thorough analysis of company’s mechanisms (audit),
- the will to give more power to the people in their company (delegating responsibility),


###b) What are they afraid of?
- the very start-up itself; such businesses are known to rise and fall,
- over-complication of the whole app (esp. non-technical people),
- the possibility of losing hold over employees work (we can counter this by emphasising the tracking and notification system)
