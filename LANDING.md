## SAVE TIME FOR PRESSING MATTERS

Stop reinventing the wheel. Keep your schedules, reuse them anytime and focus on what's really important. (+)

## WE CAN DO IT 

Your people will organize themselves, saving your time and attention. Everything's in the shifts, just release the power. (MW - release the power is a clock wording. I can get rid of it, it just fits nicely but is a bit risky. Please advise.)

## KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON 

Everything's under control, but if you want to keep an eye on the work, feel free. You've got the tools. (+)

## LET IT FLOW

If the unexpected happens, don't worry. Clockwork makes sure everything goes smoothly - it checks who's free and moves them where needed. You just get the notice. 

## BE FLEXIBLE

Swap your shifts with Clockwork: want to pick your child or go fishing? No problem - just check if someone's got a spare day! (+)

## SAVE EVERY TIME

Want to start a new project? Clockwork takes care of your means so you can go for something you've always wanted! 

## START RIGHT AWAY

No trainings or tutorials needed - Clockwork is painless and intuitive to use. It starts working when you do.

## CHECK YOUR STRENGTH

Need a spare pair of hands? Clockwork will find one. Always ready for action! (MW - rhythm is somewhat disrupted)
