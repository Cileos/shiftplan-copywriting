============

ShiftPlan stands on the shoulders of the elegant and proven Ruby on Rails. 

We've decided to use CoffeeScript to keep the frontend clear and concise. 

The database of our choosing is Postgress and all the servers will be located in Europe.

We rely on Android and iOS for the mobile version of ShiftPlan. This will allow us to install ShiftPlan on the majority of available smartphones or tablets. The idea is, to have a manager create plans on his computer/tablet so the employees can see them via their smartphones. Thanks to that, the most important thing - presence, would be achieved. Workers can exchange, or "trade" shifts, too.
