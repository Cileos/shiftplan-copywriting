ShiftPlan Features - needs to be customized to comply with the inverted pyramid
==================

##Templates(several serious and... maybe a secret one, completely bizarre, e.g. a template for building an evil empire!)
### Business won't wait. It needs goods delivered, services provided and meetings organised on time. Here's where ShiftPlan Schedules come in. We join you with a flying start.  

## Tracking (needs some thought - I don't want to sound like a wicked manager that finally will catch those absentees)
### Sometimes you just can't recall who's working on what. It's OK when you're doing statistics; less, when you've got a client in front of you and need to know it fast. No worries - here's ShiftTracker. He'll tell you what your people are doing. Nothing less, but much more if you need it. 

## Central Notification Hub (sms, twitter, e-mail, social media - unsure about the last one. Got this wacky idea about the HUB with messenger bees, need to pass the formality check ;)
### 

## Shift Trading (marketplace, bazaar)
### Some of you don't want to mess with your employees' shifts. You are interested in getting the job done. Shift Trader is build essentialy for this need. Power to the people!

## Disaster-driven planning (DDP!)
###

=============


- list of main features:
        - Templates (organize your business in schedules and reuse them as templates)
        - Tracking availability (internal workers are available by default, external are not available by default - keep track of the actual status of your workers)
        - Central Notification Hub (most systems send notifications via email, shiftplan uses a lot more notification channels - SMS, social network pings, twitter direct messages; apart from this the hub will be able to handle incoming traffic and asign the messages to the right system component)
        - Shift Trading (system helps to handle shift trades to give your employees a maximum of flexibility and minimal response time
        - desaster driven planning (e.g. an epidemic desaster takes precedence over all standard plans and will take over resources from other organizations plans within the same account)
