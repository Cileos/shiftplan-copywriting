ShiftPlan Features - needs to be customized to comply with the inverted pyramid
==================

## Shift Templates: Get started in no time.
### Use ShiftPlan instantly with the several templates available right from the beginning. A tiny or huge project, NGO or department order - everything's here. Scalable, adjustable and easy to use. No preparations required!

## ShiftTracker: Know it when you need it.
###  If you need to know who's busy and need to know it fast, ShiftTracker is the solution. It'll tell you what the staff's doing and suggest who can fill the gaps. Nothing less, but much more if you need it. 

## Central Notification Hub: It never hurts to have one little extra reminder.
### CNH makes sure the shift's staffed by sending e-mails, social media notes, tweeting and texting your workers. It's fully automated and will free you from reminding your employees about the shift changes. 

## Shift Trading: No matter who does it, as long as the job's done.
### ShiftTrader allows your workers to exchange work time without taking yours. You are interested in efficiency. Your employees want to work their shifts. Let's give power to the people!  

## Disaster-driven planning: In case of fire, don't break anything.  
### ShiftPlan handles crises easily, searching for replacements in other shift schedules. We hope that you won't suffer from epidemy or flood, but just in case, don't worry - everything's under control.

=============
* Give the names more thought.
*  Templates (organize your business in schedules and reuse them as templates)  re templates - we should point out that we shorten the time of doing the plans because the user can prepare plan skeletons with templates
* Tracking availability (internal workers are available by default, external are not available by default - keep track of the actual status of your workers)*Central Notification Hub (most systems send notifications via email, shiftplan uses a lot more notification channels - SMS, social network pings, twitter direct messages; apart from this the hub will be able to handle incoming traffic and asign the messages to the right system component)
* Shift Trading (system helps to handle shift trades to give your employees a maximum of flexibility and minimal response time
* desaster driven planning (e.g. an epidemic desaster takes precedence over all standard plans and will take over resources from other organizations plans within the same account)
