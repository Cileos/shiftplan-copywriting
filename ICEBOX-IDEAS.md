* comic - http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.117693214934401.7710.100000811701242&type=1 - page with some sketches
* video - NOT like path, a voice that is "ours": someone who emits confidence yet doesn't brag about it. A polite professional always always willing to lend a hand.
* persona - a typical client/user of our app 
* shiftplan as a swiss knife, sheriff's deputy - CONFIDENT, DEPENDABLE & READY TO ACT. 

really first rough draft:

### what does clockwork do for you:
* gives you the freedom to have a planning workflow tailored to your business (use it lean for small businesses or blow it up if your business needs more detailed planning stuff)
* involves all participients into the process of planning and makes it a “social event”
* gives you the opportunity to create the planning process as a communication process
* saves you time and gives you the space to be concentrated on other parts of your business
* informs you proactivly about your work and the involved workforces
* combine the planning with tasks and todos
* use your plan as a simple work plan, as an event plan or as a project plan

### origin of clockwork
* while helping a friend who is a hotel manager to find a good workforce management and a deeper research with him we haven’t found no good and useful service
* but there must be a lot around? yes, but none really fitted to the “special” needs like handling external resources and a few other requirements 
* on the way to specify a possible solution and the talks we had with other we’ve found out that its not special need for the gastronomical business 
* it’s for all whoever has to handle external with internal resources or wants to plan recurring and event based plans or needs proactive communication in emerging cases                                                                                                                                                    * so we refocussed on to be not focussed to a special business but to the clients who needs flexible, communicative and intuitive service which really helps
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
### mission/idea
